Exercices from the Piscine, most of whom I didn't do, although I did 2 Piscines.
I found this Piscine Reloaded quite useful. 
It gave me the opportunity to see some new notions I didn't have time for during the Piscine.
Like structure and fonction in parameters, Makefile...
Didn't manage to do the last exercise, ft_display.
